# vinit bootscripts

This repo holds a set of bootscripts/ init scripts for [vinyl-linux](https://vinyl-linux.github.io/), designed to be loaded with [vinit](https://github.com/vinyl-linux/vinit/).

These scripts are taken from [https://github.com/dslm4515/MLFS-S6-Bootscripts](https://github.com/dslm4515/MLFS-S6-Bootscripts), and adapted for vinyl/vinit.

The original README, with explanations, aims, and attributions, may be found at [README.md.original](./README.md.original).
